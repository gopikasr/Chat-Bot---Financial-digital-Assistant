Packages used
Make sure you have the below mentioned packages. If you are using colab you can use the following codes (I have already did in the Jupiter notebook)

!pip install graphviz
!pip말nstall맚orchviz
import맕umpy마s np
importrandom
import맑son
import맚orch
import맚orch.nn마s맕n
#importing맕ltk마nd맕ecessary맋ownloads
import맕ltk
nltk.download('punkt')
from맕ltk.stem.porter말mportPorterStemmer
from맚orch.utils.data말mportDataset,DataLoader
nltk.download('all')

otherwise if you are using conda, install all these separately using conda command and make sure you are running it in that respective folder

ALSO, the data is "DataChatBot.json" file. If you didnt download it also, its fine since I have included
 the code with which I created the json file in the jupiter notebook.

Running the given jupiter notebook in the colab will give you full results. I managed to include everythging in the notebook and the remaining theory in the report.
